It is essential for protecting data and systems from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. Access control can be implemented using a variety of methods, including:\n\n* **Discretionary access control (DAC)**: DAC allows the owner of a resource to grant or deny access to other users.\n* **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: RBAC allows administrators to assign users to roles, and then grant or deny access to resources based on the user's role.\n* **Mandatory access control (MAC)**: MAC restricts access to resources based on a set of rules defined by a central authority.",
