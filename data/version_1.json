      "security_control_description": "Network hardening involves implementing security measures to protect network resources from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption. It encompasses a range of techniques, including:\n\n* **Firewall configuration:** Establishing rules to restrict access to and from the network based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.\n* **Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS):** Monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity and taking action to block or mitigate threats.\n* **Virtual private networks (VPNs):** Encrypting network traffic for secure communication over public networks.\n* **Network segmentation:** Dividing the network into smaller, isolated segments to limit the spread of threats.\n* **Patch management:** Regularly updating software and systems to address vulnerabilities and security flaws.\n* **Access control lists (ACLs):** Restricting access to network resources based on user identity and role.\n* **Strong password policies:** Enforcing complex and unique passwords to prevent unauthorized access.\n* **Data encryption:** Encrypting sensitive data to protect it from eavesdropping and theft.",
