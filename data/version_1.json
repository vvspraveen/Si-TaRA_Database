Without it, organizations can experience unplanned outages, data loss, and security breaches.\n\nThe change management process typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Identifying and documenting proposed changes\n2. Assessing the impact of the changes\n3. Approving or rejecting the changes\n4. Implementing the changes\n5. Monitoring the changes and making any necessary adjustments\n\nChange management is a critical part of any IT security program. By following a formalized change management process, organizations can help to reduce the risk of unplanned outages, data loss, and security breaches.",
