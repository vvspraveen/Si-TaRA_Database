It includes actively monitoring systems, networks, applications, and user activities to identify potential threats, unauthorized access, or malicious activity. Monitoring involves using tools and techniques such as log analysis, intrusion detection, vulnerability scanning, and network traffic analysis to gather and analyze data. It also includes continuous monitoring of user accounts, system configurations, and other security-related activities to detect anomalies, deviations from established baselines, or suspicious behavior that may indicate a security issue. The goal of monitoring is to provide real-time visibility into the security posture of the organization and to enable the timely detection and response to security incidents.",
